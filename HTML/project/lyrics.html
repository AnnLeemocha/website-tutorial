                <h3>歌詞</h3>
                <pre>
    I was a ghost, I was alone, hah
    어두워진, hah, 압길속에 (Ah)
    Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe
    I was the queen that I'm meant to be
    I lived two lives, tried to play both sides
    But I couldn't find my own place
    Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild
    But now that's how I'm getting paid, 끝없이 on stage

    I'm done hidin', now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be
    We dreamin' hard, we came so far, now I believe

    We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment
    You know together we're glowing
    Gonna be, gonna be golden
    Oh, up, up, up with our voices
    영원히 깨질 수 없는
    Gonna be, gonna be golden

    Oh, I'm done hidin' now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be
    Oh, our time, no fear, no lies
    That's who we're born to be

    Waited so long to break these walls down
    To wake up and feel like me
    Put these patterns all in the past now
    And finally live like the girl they all see

    No more hiding, I'll be shining like I'm born to be
    'Cause we are hunters, voices strong, and I know I believe

    We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment
    You know together we're glowing
    Gonna be, gonna be golden
    Oh, up, up, up, with our voices
    영원히 깨질 수 없는
    Gonna be, gonna be golden

    Oh, I'm done hidin', now I'm shining like I'm born to be
    Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
    That's who we're born to be

    You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden
    We're gonna be, gonna be
    Born to be, born to be glowin'
    밝게 빛나는 우린
    You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies
    That's who we're born to be
